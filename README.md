The code begins by importing necessary libraries and loading the CIFAR-10 dataset, normalizing the images and one-hot encoding the labels. After preparing the data, it defines a convolutional neural network model with various layers, including convolutional, pooling, dropout, and dense layers. Then, the model is trained using the training data while monitoring validation performance. After training, it predicts labels for the first four test images and compares these predictions to the actual labels. Finally, it visualizes the training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs, providing insights into the model's performance during the training process.
